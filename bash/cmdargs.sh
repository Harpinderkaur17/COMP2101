#          If the help option is recognized, print out help for the command and exit
#          If the verbose option is recognized, set a variable to indicate verbose mode is on

#             display an error if the user gave the -d option without a single digit number after it
# Anything that wasn't recognized on the command line should still go into the myargs array
